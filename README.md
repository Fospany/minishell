# Minishell

## Description
Minishell is a comprehensive 42 school project tasked with creating a functional mini shell. The objective is to dive deep into systems programming, focusing heavily on process creation (`fork`, `execve`, `waitpid`), file descriptor routing, signal handling, and environment variable manipulation.
This project does not aim to be fully Bash-compatible. Behavior that is not explicitly listed below should be considered out of scope.

## Features
- **Prompt:** Displays a working prompt while waiting for a new command.
- **History:** Maintains command history using the `readline` library.
- **Execution:** Locates and executes the correct binary based on the `PATH` variable or via relative/absolute paths.
- **Quoting:** Handles single quotes (`'`) and double quotes (`"`) correctly to prevent or allow environment variable expansion.
- **Redirections:**
  - `<` redirects input.
  - `>` redirects output.
  - `<<` creates a heredoc (reading input until a delimiter is seen).
  - `>>` redirects output in append mode.
- **Pipes:** Implements piping (`|`), routing the output of one command directly into the input of the next.
- **Expansions:** Handles environment variables (e.g., `$USER`) and `$?` for the exit status of the most recently executed foreground pipeline.
- **Signals:** Handles `ctrl-C`, `ctrl-D`, and `ctrl-\` correctly, mimicking default bash behavior.

## Built-in Commands
The shell natively supports the following built-in commands without relying on external system binaries:
* `echo` (with the `-n` option)
* `cd` (with a relative or absolute path)
* `pwd` (no options)
* `export` (no options)
* `unset` (no options)
* `env` (no options or arguments)
* `exit` (no options)

## Instructions

### Compilation
Clone the repository and compile the project by running `make` at the root directory:

    make

### Execution
Run the compiled binary to enter the shell:

    ./minishell

## AI Usage

During the development of this project, Artificial Intelligence tools were utilized strictly in accordance with 42 school guidelines. AI was used as a learning assistant for:
* Generating shell edge-case scenarios to build a robust testing suite.
* Artificial Intelligence was used to assist in creating this README file.
